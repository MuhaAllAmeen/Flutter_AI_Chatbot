# Recipe.AI

This project is both a chat bot and image recognition bot with just a swipe.
This flutter app integrates the latest Gemini API to fetch data from the AI and display the response to the user in the best manner possible.
The user can ask follow up questions to the chat bot and expect a reply.
The user can upload images from gallery or their camera and ask the AI anything about the picture.

I have integrated flutter_bloc for state management and the API calls are purely natural instead of using packages for it.
I have implemented a clean UI that can help the user to find their way through working the app.

##Do not forget to add your API Key from [dev.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
